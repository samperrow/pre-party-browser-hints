Take advantage of browser resource hints and plug-and-play features to improve page load time.

== Installation Video ==

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aha9E3AXvJQ]

== Description ==

This plugin allows users to automatically and easily embed resource hints to improve page load time. 

DNS prefetch, prerender, preconnect, prefetch, and preload are all supported. 

After installation, preconnect hints will automatically be created the next time your website is visited.

You have the choice to include these resource hints in the HTTP header or the website's <head>.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `pre-party-browser-hints` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

How can I determine which URL's to enter?
Go to https://www.webpagetest.org, enter your website's URL, and click on the "waterfall" chart that appears.
a) For all resources that are loaded from external websites or domain names, I recommend inserting a preconnect link for that domain name (Preconnect is more powerful than DNS Prefetch, as it takes care of the DNS lookup, initial connection, and SSL negotiation).
b) If you have a very popular link on your site that you are confident a user would navigate towards, I recommend inserting a link for that URL with the "prerender" option set.
c) Prefetch and preload work similarly, which allows single resources to be loaded before they are requested by the user. Use this for loading images, videos, JavaScript files, etc.

How does the plugin automatically add preconnect hints?
After installing the plugin (or clicking the 'Reset Links' button), a JavaScript file will be loaded on your website (after a page is loaded) which captures the resources loaded from external domains and sends them via Ajax to your database six seconds after the page has been loaded. This script fires 6 seconds after the website has been loaded, to allow for all resources to be completely loaded.

Many websites have cache plugins that can interfere with this functionality. I have configured the JavaScript file to only function when it is in its original folder (not been merged/combined). This is to prevent it from triggering after every page load. To get this funtionality working properly, ensure that this file (/wp-content/plugins/pre-party-browser-hints/js/find-external-domains.js) is not effected by any cache plugins.

DNS Prefetch:
For all HTTP requests loaded from external sources on a page web, add the domain name of each in the "Add New Resource Hint" form, select the option for "DNS Prefetch".

Prefetch:
Insert an absolute URL for a CSS, JavaScript, image, etc, that is hosted on an external domain, and select the option "Prefetch".

Prerender:
Insert a valid URL that a visitor to your website is likely to visit, and select the option "Prerender". The URL you entered will now be loaded by the browser after all requests have been loaded on the page.

Preconnect:
For all HTTP requests loaded from external sources on a page web, add the domain name of each in the "Add New Resource Hint" form, select the option for "Preconnect". Preconnect is more powerful than DNS Prefetch, because it resolves three connections instead of one.

If you would like to have preconnect links automatically set, simply install this plugin and allow it do it the magic for you. If you would like this option disabled, just select the option to have these disabled near the bottom of the main plugin screen.

Preload:
Insert an absolute URL for a CSS, JavaScript, image, etc, and select the option "Preload".

To activate the preloaded resource, you must call that file in HTML as you would any file. For example, if you preload 'jquery.js', you must insert a script tag with a src attribute set to 'jquery.js'. Otherwise the preloaded link will be saved in the browser, but not activated in the DOM.

Sometimes that file gets cached, and its filename changes by other plugins, and constantly fires requests.
2) Made minor changes to HTML on pages and file paths.

August 3, 2020:
1) tested WP 5.5 compatbility
2) corrected bug with updating hints
3) simplified the sending of and creation of frontend hints

June 4, 2020:
1) Fixed plugin compatibility issue.

June 3, 2020:
1) added ability to edit existing hints inline asynchronously.
2) adding, updating, and deleting hints is now 100% ajax driven.
3) navigating between tabs will toggle that content's display, instead of including each tab file.
4) various other improvements to code to improve functionality.

2) Removed debug console.log message on find-external-domains.js; other minor change to that file.

1) Fixed bug with preconnect-ajax hints.
2) fixed issue with upgrading db table from v 1.5.8

September 15, 2019:

2) Removed the need for jQuery to be loaded dynamically in the "find-external-domains.js" script, and optimized the code. 100% vanilla JS now!
3) In the "Request New Feature or Report a Bug" feature, I added some info that gets sent to me to better diagnose potential plugin problems (WP version, PHP version, URL).

June 29, 2018:
1) updated a change in my GitHub username onto file paths that display HTML links on the info tab.
2) Created a plugin installation video and put it on the readme


April 27, 2018:
1) fixed bug preventing users from deleting or updating resource hint statuses.
2) fixed bug some users could notice upon installation/reactivation in the admin.php file.

April 14, 2018:
1) Fixed some UI issues on admin page (URL input field not taking up max space, jQuery sometimes not loading).
2) removed check to see if JS preconnect hint array had items before sending it to db (if it was empty, this caused the script to keep firing over and over).
3) changed some text in description.

1) removed unneccessary call on admin side for creating table.
2) fixed some bugs relating to how URL's are inserted and how the crossorigin attribute is created.
3) fixed bug in creating the header string.
4) fixed bug relating to how user options were saved on admin side.

March 31, 2018:
1) improved automatic discovery of external domains by using the Resource Timing API.
2) cleaned up UI by consolidating form elements and save buttons into one.
3) improved ability for preload hints 'as' attribute to be determined when user inputs data.
4) improved sanitization and overall URL entry process.
5) cleaned up the code which governs how hints are delivered from the db to the browser.
6) 'crossorigin' attribute is now determined on the back end.
7) added more detailed information to the Preload information section.
8) modified db table schema- added 5 columns: 'as_attr', 'type_attr', 'crossorigin', 'header_string', and 'head_string' for those respective attributes which browsers are getting more particular about. The last two columns are helpful for storing the specified links in the db, and delivering them very quickly to the browser.
9) the improvements above have been able to bring total PHP execution time on the front end down to around 0.07-0.1 milliseconds (that's 0.00007 seconds). Essentially I am shifting more of the calculations/computations to the back end when the user inputs data rather than the front end.

1) modified call order of admin.php functions
2) fixed SQL bug that occurred while deleting previous ajax hints
